# How to use?

Just run `python3 main.py`

You can also try `newmain.py`, it's a MP3 and MP4 downloader, I haven't tested it much, *could be a little unstable*

Enter the URL of the video

Enter the PATH of where you want it installed (leave blank if you want it in the same directory as the script is)

# You can also download playlists

Make sure to make the playlist publicly visible (you can disable this after downloaded)
