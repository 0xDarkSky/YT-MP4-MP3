# YT-MP3

Improved Python UI to convert Youtube URL to .mp3 file.

# How to use?

Just run `python3 main.py`

Enter the URL of the video

Enter the PATH of where you want it installed (leave blank if you want it in the same directory as the script is)

You can also use the compiled `main.exe`, but VirusTotal detects it as malware (most likely because it's Python), I still highly recommend compiling it to an .exe yourself if you need one.

# Dependencies to install

`pip install pysimplegui`

`pip install pytube`
